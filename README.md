# Theory of Languages and Automata (TLA) Midterm Project

This project was completed for the Theory of Languages and Automata course at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) during the Spring 2023 semester. It aims to explore and implement key concepts in formal languages and automata theory through a series of tasks. The project is divided into five distinct phases:

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: NFA to DFA Conversion
- **Objective**: Convert a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA).
- **Details**: This phase involves creating a DFA from an NFA by eliminating non-determinism through the subset construction method. The result is a deterministic machine that accepts the same language as the original NFA.

### Phase 2: DFA Simplification
- **Objective**: Simplify the DFA obtained in Phase 1.
- **Details**: This phase focuses on minimizing the DFA by merging equivalent states. The simplification process ensures that the DFA is in its minimal form, with no redundant states or transitions.

### Phase 3: String Acceptance on FA
- **Objective**: Implement and test string acceptance on a Finite Automaton (FA).
- **Details**: This phase involves creating a procedure to determine if a given string is accepted by the FA (NFA or DFA). It includes designing algorithms to traverse the automaton and check for string acceptance.

### Phase 4: Operations on a Regular Language
- **Objective**: Perform various operations on regular languages.
- **Details**: This phase covers operations such as union, intersection, and complementation of regular languages. It involves applying these operations to the automata and examining the resulting language properties.

### Phase 5: FA to RegEx Conversion using Arden's Lemma
- **Objective**: Convert a Finite Automaton to a Regular Expression (RegEx) using Arden's Lemma.
- **Details**: This phase focuses on deriving a regular expression that represents the language accepted by the FA. Arden's Lemma is used to construct the regular expression from the given automaton.
